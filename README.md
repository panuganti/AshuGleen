Given this is an open problem, we donâ€™t expect a particular level of correctness. What we are mainly looking for - how you approach and quickly prototype crappy solutions. Then you keep adding complex logic in iterations to achieve some satisfactory levels. While doing that journey, we expect that you may generate following artifacts - 

Hypothesis and motivations for choosing different modeling techniques.
How you measured the model performance. 
Data curation, training/evaluation data generations, model performance measurements etc.
end 2 end machine learning pipeline in python notebook including above steps.
Also, what constraints you felt which led you not to try the things you wanted to do to solve this problem is an awesome way.
** -  If you use an already available model/code/library from the web, we expect that you have a full understanding of motivation and why you are using it. Ex:- if you use entity linking library, we expect that you understand - pros and cons of that model. This includes - Why do you think your chosen entity linking library is good for your problem?  When do you expect your chosen model may behave poorly?


Iteration 1:
